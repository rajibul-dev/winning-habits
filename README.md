## 🧠 How the Point System Works

This app uses a **progressive streak-based system** to gamify habit tracking.

- Each **consecutive day** you complete your habit adds more points:
  - Day 1 = 1 point
  - Day 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 points
  - Day 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 points
  - ...and so on.
- **Miss a day?** The streak resets, but you **keep your total points**.
- The app encourages recovery too: You can always restart and keep building!

> 🎯 **1000 points is the ultimate milestone goal!**  
> It’s a small reminder that _consistency beats perfection_.
